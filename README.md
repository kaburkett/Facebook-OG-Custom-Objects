# Create Custom Facebook Objects 

This is the code I created that allows me to create custom objects with Facebook's api (and then share them with users) without using their stupid metatags at the source URL.

In the script attached in index.php you can declare the url, image, and other attributes that you want to link with an object. Then the fb.ui share_open_graph takes the id of the object you just created and allows the authenticated user to post the story.
